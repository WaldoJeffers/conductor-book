# Core concepts
## Control of the execution flow
The most important concept of **conductor** is that *you* are in control of the execution flow (it's actually this library's very goal), but you have to see this both as a *advantage* and a *constraint*. Promises are frequently blamed for [never being synchronous](https://staltz.com/promises-are-not-neutral-enough.html#never-synchronous), meaning that any function in a Promise chain will run *asynchronously*, whether this function is actually asynchronous or not.

### A quick example
Let's say we have a couple of utility functions, some synchronous and other asynchronous, and a user (Luke) whose favorite starship we would like to know.
```js
const getStarships = user => user.starships // sync
const head = array => array[0] // sync
const fetchStarship = async starship_URL => fetch(starship_URL).then(response => response.json()) // async
const getStarshipName = starship => starship.name // sync

const Luke = {
    name: 'Luke Skywalker', 
    starships: [
        'https://swapi.co/api/starships/12/', 
        'https://swapi.co/api/starships/22/'
    ]
}

```
Now, we would like to use the previous utility functions together in a `getFavoriteStarshipName` function, to retrieve the name of Luke's favorite starship. A naive (but correct!) implementation could look like this:
```js
const getFavoriteStarshipName = async user () => {
    const starships = getStarships(user)
    const starship_URL = head(starships)
    const starship = fetchStarship(starship_URL)
    const starship_name = getStarshipName(starship)
    return starship_name
}

getFavoriteStarshipName(Luke) // 'X-Wing'
```
That works! But this seems really bloated, and we should be able to write simpler code since we took the time to write these neat & concise modular functions. Could we rewrite `getFavoriteStarshipName` in a way that takes advantage that all these functions can be chained, or rather *composed* since we would like to write our code in a more minimalistic, or *point-free*, way ?

Let's try using `compose` from Ramda or Lodash:
```js
import {compose} from 'ramda' // or 'lodash.compose'

const getFavoriteStarshipName = async compose(getStarshipName, fetchStarship, head, getStarships) // remember compose works right to left
getFavoriteStarshipName(Luke) // Error
```
This throws an error, because `fetchStarship` returns a `Promise` which is not yet resolved when `starship_name` tries to retrieve the `name` property on its passed parameter. Too bad!

Oh! We suddenly remember that `Promises` have a [`then`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) method, which allows chaining. Let's use that.
```js
const getFavoriteStarshipName = user => getStarships(user).then(head).then(fetchStarship).then(getStarshipName)
getFavoriteStarshipName(Luke) // Error
```
ðŸ˜žSo close. Our code is much cleaner, and takes advantage of chainability, in an almost *point-free* style... but it does not work, because `getStarships`  does not return a `Promise`, meaning we can not use `then` on its result.

Let's make `getStarships` return a `Promise` to fix this:
```js
const getStarships = async user => user.starships // equivalent to user => Promise.resolve(user.starships)
...
const getFavoriteStarshipName = user => getStarships(user).then(head).then(fetchStarship).then(getStarshipName)
getFavoriteStarshipName(Luke) // 'X-Wing'
```
ðŸŽ‰Hooray! Now we are able to take full advantage of our neat modular functions by chaining them. But our little fix means that every time we will need to use `getStarships` to retrieve a user's starships, we will need to use it in a *asynchronous* context, either using `Promise.prototype.then` or the `await` keyword (which means that the surrounding function will need to use the `async` keyword, and its surrounding function will itself have to use `await` and so on). This does not make sense since `getStarships` is just a simple (admittedly, quite *dumb*) **synchronous** operation.

Let's say `getStarships` was also used in a simple `printStarships`:
```js
const printStarships = user => `${user.name} flies on ${getStarships(user).join().`
printStarships(Luke)// 'Luke flies on X-Wing, Millenium Falcon'
```
This function is now broken because `getStarships` returns a `Promise`.

 
[Promises are *contagious*](https://books.google.com/books?id=G7rBCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA25&lpg=PA25&dq=javascript+promises+are+contagious&source=bl&ots=NjXvlDkgSS&sig=4otCu3qz4HlEHRZwuBnpBJt5cHY&hl=fr&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=javascript%20promises%20are%20contagious&f=false=), in the sense that their asynchronous nature spreads to their whether you like it or not.

### Back to you, Larry
With **conductor**, you won't have to make all your utility functions *asynchronous*, since all the library's functions will work with both synchronous and asynchronous functions, allowing you to mix them with no hassle.
Let's pull back our attempt at using `compose` from the previous example, but this time using **conductor**'s `compose` function.
```js
import {compose} from 'conductor'

const getFavoriteStarshipName = await compose(getStarshipName, fetchStarship, head, getStarships)
getFavoriteStarshipName(Luke) // 'X-Wing'
```
Now this works, and we can achieve a proper *point-free* style, without breaking ~~a sweat~~ `getStarships`'s synchronous nature ðŸ˜Ž. It works because **conductor** knows how to handle both synchronous and asynchronous functions, but the previous code would also run (meaning *not throw an error*) if we didn't use the `await` keyword. It would simply return a `Promise` instead of a `String`. So you are in *full control* of the execution flow: you can mix synchronous and asynchronous functions in `compose`, decide exactly when you want to `await`, but don't forget that you will need to it at some point if you want to use the returned value outside of `compose`'s limits (and don't forget to [catch your errors!](https://github.com/tc39/ecmascript-asyncawait/issues/72)).
